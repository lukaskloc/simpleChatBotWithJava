<h2>Basic literals: numbers, strings and characters</h2>
<div class="step-text">
<p>Regardless of its complexity, a program always performs operations on numbers, strings, and other values. These values are called <strong>literals</strong>. There are many different sorts of literals in Java, but in this topic we will focus only on a few of them: the ones that surround us all the time in everyday life.</p>

<p>Consider literals as groceries. To use them, usually you need to store them somewhere. Typically, they are stored in variables, which you can think of as containers designed to hold a specific type of data. </p>
<p>Variables can only store matching data. You wouldn't want to accidentally put honey in a cardboard cereal box or pour cereal into a salt shaker. To prevent such mistakes, learn to distinguish between the basic literals: integer numbers, strings, and characters.</p>
<h5 id="integer-numbers">Integer numbers</h5>
<p>You use these numbers to count things in the real world as natural numbers. Integer numbers also include zero and negative ones. Here are several examples of valid integer number literals separated by commas: <code class="language-java">0, 1, 2, 10, 11, -100</code>.</p>
<p>Here is how integers can be used in code:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">int numApples = 1000;</code></pre>
<p>Reading code is crucial for anyone in IT, so let's parse it together. Here you put the integer 1000 into a variable of an integer type, called numApples. This is similar to filling a container with its designated contents!</p>
<p>You can increase code readability by dividing the digit into blocks with underscores: <code class="language-java">1_000_000</code> is more readable than <code class="language-java">1000000</code>. So let's pack our apples to make selling them easier:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">int numPackedApples = 1_000_000;</code></pre>
<p>Fear not if these code snippets aren't 100% clear to you yet! They aim to help you develop the skill of code reading. Just grasp the overall meaning and follow your study plan, and you'll be writing your own code in no time!</p>
<h5 id="characters">Characters</h5>
<p>A character is a single symbol, denoted with single quotes. You can use character literals to represent single letters like <code class="language-java">'A', 'x'</code>, digits from <code class="language-java">'0'</code> to <code class="language-java">'9'</code>, whitespaces <code class="language-java">(' ')</code>, and other characters or symbols like <code class="language-java">'$'</code>.</p>
<p>Be mindful of quotes and avoid confusing characters representing digits with the digits themselves:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">char charOne = '1'
int numOne = 1</code></pre>
<p>Fun fact: characters sit between integers and strings: they resemble strings, yet you can do math with them. </p>
<h5 id="strings">Strings</h5>
<p>A string is a sequence of characters, encapsulated by double quotes. It represents text-based information, such as an advertising line, a webpage address, or a website login name. Here are some valid examples: <code class="language-java">"text", "I want to know Java", "123456", "e-mail@gmail.com"</code>. As you can see, a string can include letters, digits, whitespaces, and other charactes altogether.</p>
<p>A string consisting of a single character like <code class="language-java">"A"</code> is also a valid string, but do not confuse it with the <code class="language-java">'A'</code> character. Note the difference in quotes!</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">char singleQuoted = 'A'
String doubleQuoted = "A"</code></pre>
<h5 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h5>
<p>You have learned to distinguish between the following literals:</p>
<ul>
<li>123 is an integer number, "123" is a string;</li>
<li>'A' is a character, "A" is a string;</li>
<li>'1' is a character, 1 is an integer number.</li>
</ul>
